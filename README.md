# 🗳️ MERN Voting System

## 🌟 Overview
This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack-based Voting System where the backend is built using TypeScript and the frontend in JavaScript. The system supports two types of users: **Admin** and **User**. Users can register using their **Aadhar number** and **Voter ID**, cast their votes, and view results when the admin decides to make them public. The Admin has the authority to manage candidates and control result visibility.

## 🔥 Features
